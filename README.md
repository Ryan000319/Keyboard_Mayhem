My first ever custom application in my foundation year is a Game made with Python and Pygame. 
This game tests the player's reaction time as the user has to press the keyboard letter as it shows up during the game. 
The player has a very short time to press the letter. 
The player is also given a "forbidden letter" which the player cannot press even if it shows up during the game. 
The player is given three lives which can be lost if: 
- the wrong letter is pressed
- player takes too long to respond
- player clicks on forbidden letter

Scoreboard tracks players that can last the longest in the game. 

Warning: Currently there are lag during keyboard presses and event triggers. This code will be optimized in the near future by a more experienced me.
